## About the Project
In this project we had to make a new abstraction with C++ that will be a game language over definitions without a new compiler. It was a challenging project because we had to think extensively how to make the pre-proccessor definitions for the game language to work. The game was a duel in Harry Potters universe with spells and a health system. It was more a predifined simulation than an actual game. In the end the project graded with a 9.6 out of 10.
